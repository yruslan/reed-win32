This project is a Windows utility that can protect your files from partial media corruption using redundancy data stored with it.
When you write a data to a rather not reliable media (such as DVD) you may create a "recovery file" that will contain a redundancy information. Using this redundancy information you may later check integrity and fix read errors of your files on the media in the future.
Currently program supports large files (>2GB), UNICODE file names. Some optimization is done for performance.
To compile from source you'll need Visual Studio 2005 or higher.
